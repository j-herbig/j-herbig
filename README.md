# Hi there

I'm Johannes. My background is in material science, but I switched to data science. My interests are in python programming, machine learning, and data visualization.

* Before I studied material science 👨‍🎓, worked in science 👨‍🔬🔬 and developed drones 🚁🪛
* I like hiking 🥾⛰️ and baking sourdough bread 🍞🥖
